# 🧠 Adaptive Learning Engine - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Status: **COMPLETE**

All requirements from **PART 6: ADAPTIVE LEARNING ENGINE** have been successfully implemented and are ready for production use.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. **Intelligent Problem Recommendation System**
- Calculates user skill level from recent performance (weighted by recency)
- Identifies weak topics (<50% success rate) and strong topics (>80%)
- Generates personalized recommendations with clear reasoning
- Mix of 60% skill-appropriate + 40% exploratory problems
- Automatic inclusion of spaced repetition reviews

### 2. **Structured Learning Paths**
- 6 predefined levels from Beginner (800) to Expert (2400)
- 100+ total problems organized by difficulty
- Automatic module organization (Data Structures, Algorithms, Graphs, etc.)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Smart path recommendations based on skill level

### 3. **Spaced Repetition System**
- SM-2 algorithm for optimal learning retention
- Automatic scheduling: 3 days → 1 week → 1 month
- Mastery detection (3 consecutive successes)
- Urgency indicators (critical, high, medium, low)
- Review statistics and upcoming reviews

### 4. **Comprehensive Metrics Tracking**
- Detailed attempt history (time, hints, test cases)
- Topic-specific mastery calculations
- Learning velocity monitoring
- Improvement rate tracking (7-day and 30-day trends)
- Automatic profile updates via database triggers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run Database Migrations

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of:
scripts/034_create_adaptive_learning_engine.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ All 7 tables
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ RLS policies for security
- ✅ Automatic triggers
- ✅ 6 learning paths (seeded)

### 2. Access the Dashboard

Navigate to:
```
https://your-domain.com/adaptive-learning
```

You'll see:
- 📊 Your skill profile (level, success rate, activity, streak)
- 🎯 Personalized problem recommendations
- 📚 Learning path progress
- 🔄 Due reviews from spaced repetition

### 3. Integrate with Problem Solving

When a user solves/attempts a problem:

```typescript
await fetch('/api/adaptive-learning/metrics', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    problem_id: '1234A',
    problem_title: 'Two Sum',
    rating: 1200,
    tags: ['implementation', 'hash-table'],
    status: 'solved', // or 'failed', 'attempted'
    time_spent_seconds: 1800,
    hints_used: 0,
    language: 'cpp'
  })
});
```

This automatically:
- Updates skill profile
- Recalculates topic mastery
- Generates new recommendations
- Adds to spaced repetition if failed

---

## 📊 Feature Highlights

### Problem Recommendations

Each recommendation shows:
```
Problem Title (clickable)
├─ Category: skill_level | weak_topic | exploratory | spaced_repetition
├─ Reasoning: "Practice DP - your success rate is below 50%"
├─ Rating: 1400
├─ Tags: [dp, greedy, math]
└─ [Solve Now] button
```

**Example Reasoning Messages**:
- ✅ "Matches your current skill level (1400)"
- ✅ "Practice DP - your success rate is below 50%"
- ✅ "Explore new topic: Binary Search"
- ✅ "🔄 Review: You struggled with this problem 2 times. Time to retry!"

### Learning Paths Structure

### Spaced Repetition Reviews

```
🔴 Critical: Two Sum Problem
  └─ 5 days overdue • Reviewed 3 times
     [Review Now]

🟡 Medium: Binary Search
  └─ Due today • Reviewed 1 time
     [Review Now]

✅ No reviews due today. Great job! 🎉
```

## 🎯 Algorithm Details

### Skill Level Calculation

```typescript
// Weighted average of last 10 solved problems
// More recent = higher weight
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  weight = 1 / (i + 1)
  sum += rating[i] * weight
  totalWeight += weight
}
skillLevel = sum / totalWeight
```

**Example**:
```
Recent solves: [1400, 1350, 1500, 1300, 1450]
Weights:       [1.00, 0.50, 0.33, 0.25, 0.20]
Skill level:   ≈ 1390
```

### Recommendation Mix

```
Total recommendations: 10

60% Skill-Appropriate (6 problems):
  - If weak topics exist:
    • 3 problems at (skill - 200) focusing on weak topic
    • 3 problems at current skill level
  - Else:
    • All 6 at current skill level ± 100

40% Exploratory (4 problems):
  - Based on improvement rate:
    • Improving: (skill + 200)
    • Stable:    (skill + 100)
  - Mix of new topics and harder problems

Priority Reviews:
  - Spaced repetition problems added at top (priority 1.0)
```

### SM-2 Spaced Repetition

```typescript
Quality Score:
  Failed  → 0 (complete blackout)
  Partial → 3 (correct with difficulty)
  Success → 5 (perfect response)

Update Ease Factor:
  newEase = oldEase + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02))
  minimum: 1.3

Calculate Next Interval:
  if (quality < 3):
    interval = 1 day         // Failed - restart
  else if (repetition == 1):
    interval = 6 days        // Second review
  else:
    interval = previous * ease  // Exponential growth
```

**Example Schedule**:
```
Day 0:   Fail problem → Added to reviews
Day 3:   Review 1 → Partial success
Day 9:   Review 2 → Success (ease = 2.5)
Day 32:  Review 3 → Success (marked as mastered)
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adjust Recommendation Mix

In `lib/adaptive-learning/recommendation-service.ts`:

```typescript
// Change from 60/40 to 70/30
const skillLevelRatio = 0.7;  // was 0.6
const exploratoryRatio = 0.3; // was 0.4
```

### Modify Spaced Repetition Schedule

In `lib/adaptive-learning/spaced-repetition-service.ts`:

```typescript
// Change initial interval from 3 to 1 day
const nextReview = this.calculateNextReview(1.0, 1); // was 3
```

### Add New Learning Paths

In SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO learning_paths (name, description, difficulty_range_min, difficulty_range_max, level_number, topics, estimated_problems)
VALUES (
  'Advanced DP Patterns',
  'Master complex DP techniques',
  1800,
  2200,
  7,
  ARRAY['dp', 'bitmask', 'digit-dp'],
  25
);
```
