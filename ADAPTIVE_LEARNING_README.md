## 🚀 Get Started (3 Steps)

### 1. Run Database Migration

In Supabase SQL Editor, execute:
```
scripts/034_create_adaptive_learning_engine.sql
```

### 2. Access Dashboard

Visit: `https://your-domain.com/adaptive-learning`

### 3. Start Solving

Record problem attempts via API:
```typescript
await fetch('/api/adaptive-learning/metrics', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    problem_id: '1234A',
    problem_title: 'Two Sum',
    rating: 1200,
    tags: ['implementation'],
    status: 'solved',
    time_spent_seconds: 1800
  })
});
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Smart Recommendations
```
"Practice DP - your success rate is below 50%"
"Based on your recent progress, try this harder problem"
"🔄 Review: You struggled with this 2 times ago"
```

### 2. Structured Learning
```
Level 1: Basics (800-1000) ───────────────── 53%
├─ Implementation (5 problems)
├─ Math (5 problems)
└─ Greedy (5 problems)
```

### 3. Spaced Repetition
```
Review Schedule:
Day 0:  Fail problem
Day 3:  First review
Day 10: Second review
Day 35: Third review → Mastered!
```

## 📊 Algorithm Highlights

### Skill Level Calculation
```typescript
// Weighted average of last 10 solved problems
skillLevel = Σ(rating[i] × weight[i]) / Σ(weight[i])
// where weight[i] = 1 / (i + 1)
```

### Recommendation Mix
```
60% Skill-Appropriate:
  - Half on weak topics (skill - 200)
  - Half at current level

40% Exploratory:
  - Slightly harder (skill + 100 to +200)
  - New topics
```

### Spaced Repetition (SM-2)
```
quality: 0 (fail) → 3 (partial) → 5 (success)
interval: 1 day → 6 days → previous × ease_factor
```
