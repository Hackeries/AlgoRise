# Build Fix Applied ✅

## Issue
Build failed with syntax error in `components/sidebar-layout.tsx`:
```
Error: Expected '</', got 'jsx text'
Line 393: </motion.aside>
```

## Root Cause
When simplifying the sidebar animations, the opening tag was changed from `<motion.aside>` to `<aside>`, but the closing tag `</motion.aside>` was not updated.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Closing Tag (Line 393)
```tsx
// Before
</motion.aside>

// After
</aside>
```

### 2. Removed Unused Import
```tsx
// Before
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';

// After
// (removed - no longer needed)
```

## Verification
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Syntax is valid
- ✅ All animations simplified to CSS transitions
- ✅ Framer-motion dependency can be removed (optional performance improvement)

## Build Status
Ready for deployment. The build should now pass successfully.
