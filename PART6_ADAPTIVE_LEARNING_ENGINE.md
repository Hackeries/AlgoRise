# PART 6: ADAPTIVE LEARNING ENGINE - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive adaptive learning engine that provides personalized problem recommendations, structured learning paths, and spaced repetition for optimal learning outcomes. The system tracks detailed user metrics and uses intelligent algorithms to guide users through their competitive programming journey.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Problem Recommendation Algorithm ✅

**Intelligent Skill-Based Recommendations**:
- Calculates user skill level from last 10 solved problems (weighted by recency)
- Generates recommendations with 60% at skill level, 40% exploratory
- Identifies weak topics (<50% success rate) and recommends easier problems in those areas
- Includes spaced repetition problems that are due for review
- Provides clear reasoning for each recommendation

**Implementation**:
- `lib/adaptive-learning/recommendation-service.ts` - Core recommendation logic
- Considers user improvement rate to adjust difficulty
- Mixes targeted practice with exploration of new topics
- Priority scoring system (0-1) for ranking recommendations

**Features**:
```typescript
interface RecommendedProblem {
  problem_id: string;
  problem_title: string;
  rating: number;
  tags: string[];
  recommendation_reason: string; // "Practice DP - your success rate is below 50%"
  priority_score: number;
  category: 'skill_level' | 'weak_topic' | 'exploratory' | 'spaced_repetition';
}
```

### 2. User Metrics Tracking ✅

**Comprehensive Metrics System**:
- Tracks every problem attempt with detailed performance data
- Calculates topic mastery for each algorithmic topic
- Monitors learning velocity (problems per week)
- Tracks improvement over time (7-day and 30-day trends)
- Identifies weak topics (<50% success) and strong topics (>80% success)

**Data Tracked Per Attempt**:
- Solve time, hints used, test cases passed
- Attempt number for each problem
- Language used, code length
- Automatic topic mastery updates via database triggers

**Skill Profile**:
```typescript
interface UserSkillProfile {
  current_skill_level: number; // Inferred from recent solves
  problems_per_week: number;
  avg_solve_time_seconds: number;
  improvement_rate: number; // % change in skill level
  weak_topics: string[]; // Topics needing improvement
  strong_topics: string[]; // Mastered topics
}
```

### 3. Learning Path Generation ✅

**Structured Progression System**:
- 6 predefined levels from Basics (800-1000) to Expert (1900-2400)
- Each level has multiple modules organized by topic category
- Automatic progress tracking
- Smart path recommendation based on current skill level

**Learning Levels**:
```
Level 1: Basics (800-1000)
  ├─ Implementation, Math, Brute Force, Greedy
  └─ 15 problems

Level 2: Data Structures (1000-1200)
  ├─ Data Structures, Sorting, Binary Search, Two Pointers
  └─ 15 problems

Level 3: Algorithm Fundamentals (1200-1400)
  ├─ Greedy, DP, Graphs, DFS
  └─ 15 problems

Level 4: Advanced Algorithms (1400-1600)
  ├─ DP, Graphs, Trees, DSU
  └─ 15 problems

Level 5: Problem Solving Mastery (1600-1900)
  ├─ DP, Graphs, Trees, Strings, Segment Trees
  └─ 20 problems

Level 6: Expert Challenges (1900-2400)
  ├─ DP, Graphs, Strings, Number Theory, Geometry
  └─ 20 problems
```

**Features**:
- Modules auto-generated from topics (Data Structures, Algorithms, Graphs, Math, Strings)
- Progress percentage calculation
- Status tracking (not_started, in_progress, completed, paused)
- Prerequisite handling for advanced levels

### 4. Spaced Repetition System ✅

**SM-2 Algorithm Implementation**:
- Adds failed problems automatically to review queue
- Initial review scheduled 3 days after failure
- Adjusts intervals based on performance (SM-2 quality 0-5)
- Tracks ease factor and interval days per problem
- Marks problems as "mastered" after 3 consecutive successes

**Review Scheduling**:
```
Failed (quality 0):     Reset to 1 day
Partial (quality 3):    Moderate interval increase
Success (quality 5):    Full interval increase (×ease factor)

Default intervals:
- First review:  1 day
- Second review: 6 days  
- Third+ review: previous_interval × ease_factor
```

**Features**:
- Urgency classification (critical, high, medium, low) based on days overdue
- Review statistics dashboard
- Archive option for problems user doesn't want to review
- Automatic addition when problems are failed

```typescript
// Get cached recommendations
const recs = await fetch('/api/adaptive-learning/recommendations');

// Generate fresh recommendations
const freshRecs = await fetch('/api/adaptive-learning/recommendations?refresh=true');
```

```

## 🚀 Algorithm Highlights

### Skill Level Calculation

```typescript
// Weighted average of last 10 solved problems
// More recent problems weighted more heavily
weight[i] = 1 / (i + 1)
skillLevel = Σ(rating[i] × weight[i]) / Σ(weight[i])
```

### Recommendation Mix

```
60% Skill Level Problems:
  - If weak topics exist: 50% focus on weak topics at (skill - 200)
  - Remaining: General problems at current skill level

40% Exploratory Problems:
  - If improving: (skill + 200)
  - If stable: (skill + 100)
  - Mix of new topics and slightly harder problems

Priority Reviews:
  - Spaced repetition problems get highest priority (1.0)
  - Added at the top of recommendations list
```

### SM-2 Spaced Repetition

```typescript
// Update ease factor based on quality (0-5)
newEase = oldEase + (0.1 - (5 - quality) × (0.08 + (5 - quality) × 0.02))
newEase = max(1.3, newEase)

// Calculate next interval
if (quality < 3) {
  interval = 1 day // Failed - restart
} else if (repetition == 1) {
  interval = 6 days
} else {
  interval = previousInterval × ease
}
```
